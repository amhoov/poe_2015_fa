This is a shell repository for collecting and voting on project ideas. Please submit at least three ideas of your own and vote
on as many ideas as you like as many times as you like. Feel free to include links to images, videos, and other documentation
in your idea submission. The more supporting material, the easier it is for someone to decide how to vote on your idea.
